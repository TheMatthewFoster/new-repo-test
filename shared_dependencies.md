Shared Dependencies:

1. **React**: Used in all frontend files for creating components and managing the app state.

2. **Express.js**: Used in all backend files for handling HTTP requests and responses.

3. **MongoDB Schemas**: `WaterIntake` and `User` schemas are used in their respective models and controllers. The `WaterIntake` schema includes fields like `userId`, `date`, and `intakeAmount`. The `User` schema includes fields like `username`, `password`, and `email`.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: IDs like `logWaterButton`, `dailySummary`, and `reminderSettings` are used in the corresponding frontend components and may be referenced in `App.js` for routing or state management.

5. **Function Names**: Functions like `logWater`, `getDailySummary`, `setReminder`, `registerUser`, `loginUser`, and `logoutUser` are used across multiple files. These functions are defined in the backend controllers and used in the frontend components and services.

6. **Route Names**: Route names like `/waterIntake`, `/user`, `/register`, `/login`, and `/logout` are defined in the backend routes and used in the frontend services for making API requests.

7. **NotificationService**: This service is used in `ReminderSettings.js` for scheduling reminders and in `App.js` for handling incoming notifications.

8. **AuthService**: This service is used in `App.js` for managing user sessions and in components like `LogWaterButton.js`, `DailySummary.js`, and `ReminderSettings.js` for checking user authentication.

9. **Database Configuration**: The database configuration in `database.js` is used in `server.js` for connecting to the database and in the models for defining the schemas.

10. **Auth Configuration**: The auth configuration in `auth.js` is used in `server.js` for setting up the authentication middleware and in `userRoutes.js` for protecting certain routes.

11. **Notification Configuration**: The notification configuration in `notifications.js` is used in `server.js` for setting up the notification services and in `waterIntakeRoutes.js` for scheduling reminders.
